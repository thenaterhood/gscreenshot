gscreenshot is a gtk frontend for scrot, an application for taking screenshots,
written in python and pygtk. This is a fork of the original project (last
updated in 2006) that updates it to use modern technologies and to provide
updated functionality.

This application was originally written by matej.horvath. The original project
can be found at https://code.google.com/p/gscreenshot/ while Google Code is
still up and running.
